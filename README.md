Basic react app to be used as a damage calculator. Soon to be hosted at cycalc.daviddavydov.tech.

## To Do (ordered):

 * ☑ ~~Sketch and brainstorm possible layouts.~~
 * ☑ ~~Create project and crude mock-up.~~
 * ☑ ~~Make website fully responsive and test on multiple screen sizes~~
 * ☐ Refine mock-up to closer represent the final website. **[In progress]**
 * ☐ Finish general mock-up of the site.
 * ☐ Finish cleaning up the site's look by fixing the issues with the accordiant list cap, fixing css related to popovers/tooltips, figuring out the graph's look, adding a options menu, etc.
 * ☐ Make components fully functional instead of mock-up placeholders.
 * ☐ Add a service for shared starts (redux, react shared state, maybe react hooks if you're lazy.)
 * ☐ Add the graph to the right panel.
 * ☐ Connect all components to the store and make the calculator functional.
 * ☐ Remove unneeded dependencies. (Optionally consider moving to Preact.)
 * ☐ Clean up unneeded files, create custom version of the bootstrap CSS (or discard entirely and use homebrew css after prototyping.)
 * ☐ Finish preparing for production.
 * ☐ Deploy final version.
